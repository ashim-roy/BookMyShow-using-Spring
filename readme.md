Steps :-

1. Create a basic SpringBoot Project.
2. Code all the Model classes (From class diagram)


In a typical Java backend application, especially when following an architecture like MVC (Model-View-Controller) or similar patterns, various components play specific roles:

Repository:

Responsibilities:
Handles data access and persistence logic.
Communicates with the database (or any other data storage) directly.
Characteristics:
Contains methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities.
Often defined as interfaces and implemented by frameworks like Spring Data JPA.
Service:

Responsibilities:
Implements business logic and rules.
Orchestrates interactions between different repositories or external services.
Acts as a bridge between the controller (or API) layer and the data access layer.
Characteristics:
Contains methods that encapsulate complex operations or workflows that involve multiple repositories or domain objects.
Can perform transaction management and validation.
Controller:

Responsibilities:
Receives and handles incoming requests from clients (like a web browser or mobile app).
Interacts with services to fetch data or trigger actions.
Responsible for returning the appropriate HTTP responses.
Characteristics:
Contains methods (endpoints) that handle specific HTTP requests.
Handles request parameters, headers, and bodies, then delegates business logic to services.
DTO (Data Transfer Object):

Responsibilities:
Acts as a carrier for data between the client and the server (or between different layers).
Helps in transferring data in a structured format without exposing the underlying domain model directly.
Characteristics:
Contains fields that represent data transferred over the network.
Often used to encapsulate specific data needed by the client to prevent exposing the entire domain model.
These components work together in a layered architecture to maintain separation of concerns and manage different aspects of an application:

Controller interacts with incoming requests, passes data to services, and returns appropriate responses.
Service holds the business logic, validates data, and orchestrates interactions between multiple repositories.
Repository deals with data access and database operations.
DTO aids in transporting data between layers, allowing controlled access and preventing direct exposure of domain models.
This separation helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase, improves testability, facilitates reusability, and makes the application more maintainable and scalable
